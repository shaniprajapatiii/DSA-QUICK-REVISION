/* Given an array arr[] representing the heights of towers and a positive integer k, we can modify each towerâ€™s height exactly once by either adding k or subtracting k. After these modifications, find the minimum possible difference between the tallest and the shortest tower.
   Note: It is compulsory to increase or decrease the height by k for each tower. After the operation, the resultant array should not contain any negative integers.
*/
/*
[Approach] Using Sorting - O(n logn) Time and O(1) Space
We bring the towers closer by increasing the shorter ones and decreasing the taller ones. After sorting, we try splitting the array at some point: towers on the left are increased by +k, and towers on the right are decreased by -k.

/*
 * Example :
 * Input: k = 2, arr[] = [1, 5, 8, 10]
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: The array can be modified as [1+k, 5-k, 8-k, 10-k]= [3, 3, 6,
 * 8]. The difference between the largest and the smallest is 8 - 3 = 5.
 * 
 * Input: k = 3, arr[] = [3, 9, 12, 16, 20]
 * Output: 11
 * Explanation: The array can be modified as [3+k, 9+k, 12-k, 16-k, 20-k] = [6,
 * 12, 9, 13, 17]. The difference between the largest and the smallest is 17 - 6
 * = 11.
