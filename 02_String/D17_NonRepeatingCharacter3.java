/*  [Efficient Approach 2] By Storing Indices (Single Traversal) â€“ O(n) Time and O(MAX_CHAR ) Space
The above approach can be optimized using a single traversal of the string. The idea is to maintain a visited array of size MAX_CHAR initialized to -1, indicating no characters have been seen yet. Now, we iterate through the string:

If a character is seen for the first time, its index is stored in the array. 
If the character is found again then its array value is set to -2 to represent this character is now repeating. 
After the string traversal, traverse the visited array and check if value in the array is not equal to -1 or -2 (means, this character is not repeating). We then find the smallest positive index from these values to find the first non-repeating character. If no such index is found, return '$'.
